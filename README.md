### Project 1
General description of the project or content of the repository.
This project was involved with the exploration of a provided database movie rentals in which I had to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the queries. I was given the option to use either the some predefined questions which ensured that the queries to get them solved involved the key concepts taught in the lectures or to choose my own question set. I did use the given questions.

### List of files included in the project.

The project required that we make available a file that contains four queries that were run and another file showing a visualization of all the four slides obtained from running the queries. The file with the queries is named 'Ndzis_queries' and the visualization file is named "NdzisCopyofSQLProjectSubmissionTemplate" 

### Running the queries
The queries were executed from within the workspace provided me by Udacity and the results were exported and then ploted in excel.
